					<p>The signing of the Constitution marks a significant event during the 3rd period of American History. The Constitution was
					a document that had to live up to enormous expectations. First, the Constitution had to be vague enough to be valid for several
					centuries, not a very easy task. Many other constitutions had to be amended several times, or even completely replaced very often
					due to incompatibilities. However, the constitution's basic principles have survived from 1788 to present, with only minor amendments.
					The image shows the many delagates, finally agreeing on the finalized version of the constitution, which took many debates and edits
					over the course of 4 months.</p>

					</div>
					
					<p>The constitution also had to be specific enough as to avoid the citizenry from finding loopholes. The founding fathers created
					a specific structure of government that is still in practice to this day, and took almost every factor into consideration. This
					image perfectly represents the period, since it captures the struggle to create and perfect a new system of government, which
					occured throughout the period. The government was edited, amendments were passed, and it was a time of mostly trial-and-error.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>In the years after the revolution, the United States, than only an infant country, was under the Articles of Confederation.
					The Articles created a system of government which was very loose, and resulted in a very weak central government. After repeated
					problems, the country quickly realized that the new system was very inefficient, and left the young country very vunerable to
					outside attacks. In 1787, after Shay's rebellion in Massachussetts, several delegates met in Philadelphia to amend the Articles.
					However, rather than just amending the Articles, they replaced it entirely with a new Constitution. These course of events show
					how the United States is ready to adapt to any situation. Furthermore, the Constitution was designed in a way that would allow
					for the document to be adapted to fit the needs of the time period. For example, the 13th amendment made sure that slaves were
					emancipated in order to fit the morals of a new time period. Just a century earlier, it was considered moral to own a slave.
					In fact, the constitution has been amended over 30 times, and is the longest surviving document to govern a country.</p>
					<p>Today, however, there is a reluctance to amend the constitution. The biggest example of this is the 2nd amendment, which
					guarantees every citizen the right to bear arms. Unfortunately, this was written in the late 1700s, when the most powerful guns
					were muskets. Today, weapons can fire over 10 rounds every second, which is excessive for the average citizen. Despite attempts
					to amend this amendment, lobbyists such as the NRA (National Rifle Association) have repeatedly rejected the proposal referencing
					the 2nd amendment. Amendments in the past, however, have been repealed and amended; such as the Prohibition amendment, which was
					quickly repealed when the population realized it was having no effect. Despite this issues, it must be remembered that most
					amendments have always had a lot of debate before going through, as is the tradition of the United States. President Lincoln
					fought an entire war over the 13th amendment to get it recognized in the South. In the US, a debate is always considered healthy, 
					as it allows the country to consider different points of view before making a major decision.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Continuity Over Time</h2>
					<p>Although much changed between the colonial era and the revolutionary era, there were still many commonatlities. Although the
					Articles of Confederation was created to be a total opposite of the British Empire, however, this quickly fell apart. The resulting
					system of government was very similar to the British bicameral system of legislature, with one ruler. States still retained their
					local legislatures which were relatively similar to their system of government before the election. However, many things changed 
					between the two eras. For example, Americans moved away from the idea of a monarchy to a democracy after the French and Indian
					war. Americans also believed that the populus should get equal representation in Parliament, which led to the breakout of the
					American revolution. Furthermore, Americans had revolutionary ideas which completely differed from Europe, and actually served
					as a model for European countries such as France and eventually Britain. Americans also embraced older European ideas such as the
					unalieanable rights from John Locke during the Enlightenment.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conflicting Sources</h2>
					<p>In the lead-up to the American Revolution, both Britain and the colonies had separate views of the disastrous situation in 
					the colonies. After the French and Indian War, Britain was under a lot of debt, and needed to pay it off. "And We do further
					strictly enjoin and require all Persons whatever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any Lands
					within the Countries above described, or upon any other Lands, which, not having been ceded to, or purchased by Us, are
					still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such Settlements." (George, 1763). One
					of the ways they accomplished this was by preventing the Americans from crossing the frontier. Furthermore, Britain imposed
					several taxes on the colonials, which destroyed the American economy. This made the colonists very upset and they started
					harrasing several British officials. King George, however saw this as malicious and this led to the port of Boston being closed.
					In the second pictures, the British depict the sons of liberty "Tarring and Feathering" a British official with no mercy.
					The colonists felt that they should not be taxed, without recieving adequate representation. However, Britain felt that the
					colonists were being represented "virtually". This major difference in point of view resulted mainly from the geographical
					difference of the two parties: One being in Britain, and one in the colonies. Life in the colonies was very different from
					life in Britain. However, the British saw the colonists as unruly and felt they were right. The colonists felt as though the
					British were being tyrannic. These severely differences in point-of-view was one of the many factors that led to the eventual
					independence of the United States from Great Britain.</p>

					Us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such Settlements.  And whereas great
					Frauds and Abuses have been committed in the purchasing Lands of the Indians, to the great Prejudice of Our Interests, and to the

					Privy Council, declare and enjoin, that the Trade with the said Indians shall be free and open to all Our Subjects whatever;
					provided that every Person who may incline to trade with the said Indians, do take out a License for carrying on such Trade from
					the Governor or Commander in Chief of any of Our Colonies respectively, where such Person shall reside; and also give Security
					to observe such Regulations as We shall at any Time think fit, by Ourselves or by Our Commissaries to be appointed for this
					urpose, to direct and appoint for the Benefit of the said Trade; and We do hereby authorize, enjoin, and require the Governors
					and Commanders in Chief of all Our Colonies respectively, as well Those under Our immediate Government as Those under the
					Government and Direction of Proprietaries, to grant such Licenses without Fee or Reward, taking especial Care to insert therein 
					a Condition, that such License shall be void, and the Security forfeited, in case the Person, to whom the same is granted, shall
					refuse or neglect to observe such Regulations as We shall think proper to prescribe as aforesaid.

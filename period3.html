					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>In the years after the revolution, the United States, than only an infant country, was under the Articles of Confederation.
					The Articles created a system of government which was very loose, and resulted in a very weak central government. After repeated
					problems, the country quickly realized that the new system was very inefficient, and left the young country very vunerable to
					outside attacks. In 1787, after Shay's rebellion in Massachussetts, several delegates met in Philadelphia to ammend the Articles.
					However, rather than just amending the Articles, they replaced it entirely with a new Constitution. These course of events show
					how the United States is ready to adapt to any situation. Furthermore, the Constitution was designed in a way that would allow
					for the document to be adapted to fit the needs of the time period. For example, the 13th amendment made sure that slaves were
					emancipated in order to fit the morals of a new time period. Just a century earlier, it was considered moral to own a slave.
					In fact, the constitution has been amended over 30 times, and is the longest surviving document to govern a country.</p>
					<p>Today, however, there is a reluctance to amend the constitution. The biggest example of this is the 2nd amendment, which
					guarantees every citizen the right to bear arms. Unfortunately, this was written in the late 1700s, when the most powerful guns
					were muskets. Today, weapons can fire over 10 rounds every second, which is excessive for the average citizen. Despite attempts
					to amend this amendment, lobbyists such as the NRA (National Rifle Association) have repeatedly rejected the proposal referencing
					the 2nd amendment. Amendments in the past, however, have been repealed and amended; such as the Prohibition amendment, which was
					quickly repealed when the population realized it was having no effect. Despite this issues, it must be remembered that most
					amendments have always had a lot of debate before going through, as is the tradition of the United States. President Lincoln
					fought an entire war over the 13th amendment to get it recognized in the South. In the US, a debate is always considered healthy, 
					as it allows the country to consider different points of view before making a major decision.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">An Image of the Era</h2>
					
					<p>This image perfectly illustrates the struggle for power between poor white farmers and rich aristocrats. Throughout the
					colonies, many class conflicts occured before the French and Indian War. Due to indentured servitude, many poor British men
					came over to the colonies and worked for several years. After they finished their servitude, they did not recieve housing
					or clothing, and instead went westward to establish their own settlement. One of such settlements, was in Virginia. A white
					farmer named Nathaniel Bacon lived in Western Virginia, and his community was continually harrased by Native Americans. The
					current governer of Virginia (Governer Berkeley), did not take any action and this angered many lower class colonists.</p>

						<span class="caption text-muted">The Burning of Jamestown During Bacon's Rebellion.</span>
					</div>
					
					<p>Eventually Bacon and his followers decided to take action, and attacked innocent tribes. This actually ended up hurting
					Governer Berkeley's fur trade operation and he ordered Bacon to stop. Angered by this, Bacon and his followers marched
					on Jamestown. They burned the entire city to the ground and Berkeley and his forces retreated. Fortunately for
					Governer Berkeley, Bacon suddenley died due to health reasons, and Berkeley was able to take back the ruined city. This
					is one of the more famous examples of the early colonial power struggle between different classes and in some ways, caused
					major changes to ensure that such an event couldn't happen again. In particular, racism was used to united the white colonists
					against their black slaves.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>Nathaniel Bacon's rebellion shows us what happens when class tensions become extreme, and one class is treated unfairly
					over another. However to remedy this problem, colonial administration simply solved the problem by putting more emphasis on
					racial divides. This still impacts America as a country today, after 400 years. Even after the civil war, racial tensions
					still existed throughout the 20th and now into the 21st century. In some ways it is becoming worse. Today's Black Lives Matter
					movement shows how racial tensions can quickly turn into protest, and sometimes violence. Sometimes these movements have no
					legitement purpose. A lot of times, the system is truly unfair, such as the equality and civil rights movement in the 1960s,
					which was spearheaded by African Americans. With the United States' influx of immigrants, it's hard to unite the country as
					a whole, and the problem has since expanded from just African Americans to several races. However, despite what many people
					think, racism and inequality has gone down severely since the Civil Rights Movement and the US has become much more open to
					immigration and different races. In the time of Bacon's rebellion, most white settlers were very racist towards even Europeans,
					let alone Africans. But despite the decrease in racism over the centuries, the problem still exists, since even the most disliked
					men are successful in capturing just under half of the United States population through racism, and white supremacy. This shows
					the inherent similarty throughout American history, of division, but also diversity. Diversity is a positive thing, but causes
					issues that must be overcome.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conflicting Sources</h2>
									
					<p>Life in Virginia was clearly illustrated by Sebastian Brandt as dreary and very unpleasant. Government wasn't even possible, since many people
					perished due to "sicknesse & weakenesse" (Brandt). Conversely, in Boston, the Puritans were living a much better lifestyle. They were able to create a "civil Government" (Winthrop)
					due to the stability of the population. The nearby natives were not major threats to the Puritans, due to disease. Life in New England allowed for
					people to think about a just and equal government, as opposed to Virginia, where it grew as a more aristocratic society, due to the harshness of the
					land. In Virginia, the settlers must recieve food from England, because they cannot find adequate food on their own. New England was very adept at
					generating their own food supply and being very self sufficient, which also allowed for greater autonomy until the French and Indian War. Jamestown,
					on the other hand, had to be taken over by the government due to the Virginia Company's apparent failure to maintain the colony, and the lack of revenue
					produced. It was not until John Rolfe brought Tobacco to Jamestown, that it became a viable and somewhat prosperous settlement, but even so, had significant
					racial and class divides and a much weaker government during the era. The main reason for these major differences is the purpose of the settlements.
					Whereas New England was founded for mostly religious regions (as can be seen by Winthrops' constant references to God), Virginia was founded as a revenue
					generating colony. As a result, women rarely came over to Virginia except to be a worker in the fields, and this resulted in very low
					birth rates in Virginia. This, combined with swampy conditions and diseases, caused Virginians' to face many obstacles, and struggle to survive. New
					England's climate was much more temperate, and had many more families, which ensured a stable birth rate. The lack of disease baring mosquitoes, meant
					that the mortality rate was low as well, allowing for a stable government.</p>

					<blockquote>Worthye Sr<br />
					That you are pleased among yr many & weighty imployments to spend so many serious thoughts and good wishes upon us, & the work
					of the Lord in our hands, I must needs acknowledge it among other the special favours of God towards us, and an undoubted testimony
					of yr sincere Love towards us: which makes me the more careful to satisfy yr desire, of being truly informed of our estate
					(this being the first safe means of Conveyance since I received yrs in October last) you may please therefore to understand that
					first, for the number of our people, we never took any survey of them, nor do we intend it, except inforced through urgent occasion
					(David’s example sticks somewhat with us) [some Protestants interpreted the Bible as forbidding a census] but I esteem them to be in
					all about 4000 souls & upward: in good health (for the most parse) & well provided of all necessarys: so as (through the Lords special
					providence) there hath not died about 2: or 3: grown persons, & about so many Children all in the last year, it being verye rare to heare
					of any sick of agues or other diseases, nor have I known of any quartan Ague amonge us since I came into the Countrye. For Our susistence
					here, the means hitherto hath been the yearly access of new Comers, who have supplied all our wants, for Cattle, & the fruits of our
					labours, as board, pale, smiths work etc: if this should fail, then we have other meanes which may supply us, as fish viz: Cod, bass &
					herring, for which no place in the world exceeds us, if we can compass salt at a reasonable rate: our grounds likewise are apt for hemp
					& flax & rape seeds, & all sorts of roots, pumpkins & other fruits, which for taste & wholesomeness far exceed those in England: our grapes
					also (wherewith the Country abounds) afford a good hard wine. Our ploughs go on with good success, we are like to have 20 at work next
					year: our lands are aptest for Rye and oats. Our winters are sharp & longe, I may reckon 4 months for storing of cattle, but we find no
					difference whither they be housed or go abroad: our summers are somewhat more fervent in heat than in England. Our civil Government is
					mixt: the freemen choose the magistrates every year . . . and at 4: courts in the year 3: out of each town (there being 8 in all) do assist
					the magistrates in making of laws, imposing taxes, & disposing of lands: our furies [?] are chosen by the freemen of everye town. Our
					Churches are governed by Pastors, Teachers ruling Elders & Deacons, yet the power lies in the whole Congregation and not in the Presbytery
					[not in a larger council of churches] further than for order and precedence. For the natives, they are near all dead of the smallpox, so the
					Lord hath cleared our title to what we possess.

					<p>The Caning of a Senator on the eve of the Civil War displays the extent of the tensions between the North and the South.
					The half century of compromises was about to give way to the inevitible. Instead of condemning the attacker, Southerners
					instead cheered him	on. This further increased the sectional divides between North and South, and although secession wasn't
					yet considered, it was clear that the North and South were growing as two separate nations.</p>

						<span class="caption text-muted">The Caning of Senator Sumner.</span>
					</div>
					
					<p>In this particular image, Senator Brooks canes Senator Sumner after Sumner delivers a long speech about the 'Crimes
					against Kansas'. This sparked outrage from the Northerners and was one of the events that helped the Republican Party gain
					votes. Meanwhile, Brooks was treated as a hero in the South. This one event showed that even the government couldn't isolate
					itself from the sectional conflict and to the extent in which it divided the nation. This event also describes the period as
					a whole of sectional conflict which existed before, during, and after the Civil War.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>Sectional conflicts that existed during the Civil War weren't solved during the 10 years of Reconstruction. In fact,
					sectional conflicts	would continue to rage throughout the 20th century with the Civil Rights Movement and still exist today
					in the 21st century. There is still	a large racial divide between the North and the South, which was one of the contributing
					factors to Trump's victory. Although the conflict isn't as intense as it was on the eve of the Civil War, it highlights the
					lasting impact of the failures of Reconstruction. Some movements such as "Black Lives Matter" still continue to fight for
					equal treatment. Even though the law guarantees equal protection, some of the South's mindset has not changed since
					Reconstruction. The United States is still torn between old viewpoints and accepting the new, generational differences, and
					regional contrasts. Societies such as the Klu Klux Klan still exist today, even after they were looked down on by almost
					all the Northerners for their atrocious crimes. Much of the old mindset can still be seen in the turnout to Trump rallies
					where they encourage rasism against several racial groups. Many of these lasting issues can be attributed to the failure of
					reconstruction to heal the divide in the country and instead finished Reconstruction before it was truly complete. In many
					ways, the people of the 20th and 21st centuries are finishing Reconstruction themselves. Trump has much of his voter base
					in Southerners who still feel the same way as their ancestors after the Civil War.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Continuity Over Time</h2>
					<p>Many older sentiments from the previous period remained the same during this era but much more intense. Abolitionists
					had existed since the revolution, however after the many reforms of the previous period, they could now take the movement
					to the next level. The Reform Era in the North sparked huge support for the abolitionist movement and it picked up during
					this era. On the other hand, rascist sentiments replaced the Nativism from the previous era as their anger was turned
					towards the Northerners and abolitionists. The North had begun industrializing since the previous period and the North's
					economy surpassed the South's agricultural based economy. The Civil War helped with the North's industrialization since
					production was now faster and more efficient. Meanwhile, the South attempted to regress to it's pre-Civil War state of
					agriculture. Politics, however, changed significantly from the previous period to the start of the Civil War. In the early
					1800s, the country had a one party "Era of Good Feeling", and politics was very stable. However, this didn't last long and
					several parties formed once again. This time, it was around the issue of slavery and what should be done with it. Many
					northerners felt that slavery shouldn't be expanded and should be gradually abolished. This issue was made worse by the
					addition of new territories from Mexico and the admission of new states in the Louisiana Purchase. Southerners felt that
					slavery should be extended into these new states, however the North felt that this was unconstitutional. A particular
					suggestion was known as Popular Soverienghty which would give the states the right to choose based on votes. However,
					this didn't work and compromises had to be made. Eventually, the new Republican Party got it's way, and the South seceded.
					Even after losing the war, however, prejudices remained. After 10 years of Reconstruction, the North no longer wanted to
					fund Reconstruction, and instead focus on Industrialization and settling in the west. This led to the rise of discrimination
					against former slaves and immigrants in the South, which lasted until the late 20th century with the Civil Rights Movement.
					Even today, in the early 21st century, discrimination still occurs in the South to a smaller extent than after Reconstruction.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conflicting Sources</h2>
					<p>Before the Civil War, there were various responses from the North on how to handle the South's grievances against abolitionists.
					In Abraham Lincoln's inaugration speech, Lincoln states that he will "preserve, protect, and defend" the Union, even it it meant war.
					Meanwhile, others attempted to appease the South and prevent secession by trying to pass an amendment to deny "Congress the power to
					abolish or interfere, within any State, wih the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by
					the laws of said State." Lincoln was more interested in preserving the Union, and in his mind, the South had initiated the conflict. 
					He states that the "You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors." Meanwhile, most of the moderate Republicans
					didn't want a Civil War as they felt the conflict could be resolved without war. Lincoln, on the other hand, felt that without
					the abolition of slavery, the Union would never truly be together. By the time he had written his speech, states had already began
					seceding from the Union and forming the Confederation. Much of Congress thought that war would break apart the Union, and had a fear
					that the Confederation might win the war. The main reason for this disagreement was many of the Republican's fear that they might
					not win, whereas Lincoln was almost certain that he was going to win. In fact he calls them "fellow countrymen" suggesting that he
					considered them a part of the Union.</p>

					article be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which,
					when ratified by three-fourths of said Legislatures, shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution,
					viz:<br />
					<br />
					ARTICLE XIII.<br />
					<br />

					<blockquote>
					In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not
					assail you. You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy
					the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to “preserve, protect and defend” it.
					<br /><br />
					I am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break
					our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart
					nd hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by
					the better angels of our nature.

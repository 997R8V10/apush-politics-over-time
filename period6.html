					<p>In the late 18th century, politics was dominated by political machines and corruption.
					Powerful "bosses" would control the counting of votes and provide money to the poor in exchange
					for votes. This was just a small part of the corruption that existed in local, state, and federal
					governments.</p>

						<span class="caption text-muted">Boss Tweed and Political Machines by Thomas Nast</span>
					</div>
					
					<p>In the cartoon by Thomas Nast, William Tweed, the boss for New York City, is shown
					counting the votes of the ballot and says "As long as I count the Votes, what are you going to
					do about it?" Every time someone tried to bring Tweed down, he would use his control of the
					political system to save himself. Tweed ended up swindling the City of New York out of several
					hundreds of thousands of dollars through corruption. Events such as this represented the issues
					of industrialization and the existing system's inability to cope with these issues.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>Several of the events that happened during industrialization are very similar to the events
					that occur in the 21st century. In the late 19th century, there was a lot of push toward wage
					reform for workers since many workers were toiling in dangerous conditions with very litte pay.
					Often, capitalists argued that they were providing incentive to the workers to try to work harder
					and make more money. These sentiments still exist today and is heavily debated in several sectors
					of government. In Seattle, a $15 minimum wage was established, but had the unintended consequence
					of requiring the businesses to lay off some of their workers. Many people still believe that a
					capitalist economy is the most beneficial for the country, where others argue that a more socialistic
					economy would be more beneficial. In the 19th century, these were the Progressives. Although they weren't
					socialist, they argued for an equality of wealth and regulation of corporations. Even today,
					the US government has to make decisions on corporations and their treatment of workers. Some people
					continue to push forward with the Progressive argument in the 21st century while others believe that
					the Progressives have already completed what they set out to do. Even after a century, the nation must
					balance the power between the people, the government, and the corporations.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Continuity Over Time</h2>
					<p>Much of the late 19th century was marked by significant changes in the economy and a move away
					from the Lincoln Agrarian society after the Civil War. The Industrial Revolution that had been started
					before the Civil War was sped up and better funded to allow for a lot of growth in a short time. By
					1890, the amount of railroad miles had almost doubled from after the Civil War and less than 20 percent
					of the population still worked on agricultural farms. However, this economic growth was relatively isolated
					from the South after the Civil War. The South had some industrialized cities but they weren't as big and
					only grew in the late 20th century. Immigration and population growth also changed from the previous period
					as more people saw the victory of the union as a sign that the US was a safe haven and place where freedom
					was truly free. However, despite the increase in industrialization, many of the workers social status was
					significantly reduced and capitalists would commonly pay their workers low wages and force them to work
					long hours and in dangerous conditions. The government now had to work out an additional third enitity
					and it's relationship with the government and the people: Corporations. The government struggled with this
					as seen in the change from the 5th to the 6th period as it tried to stay out of corporations way as much
					as possible. As a result, corporations gained significant power during the late 19th century and although
					legislation was passed, it would not be effective until the early 20th century. Many of the problems that
					existed in the late 19th century were solved in the 20th century, however, these problems still exist in
					a smaller scale today. The government still has to decide how to regulate the relationship between the government,
					corporations, and the people and how to protect the worker's rights from being infringed by the corporations.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conflicting Sources</h2>
					<p>During the late 18th century there were several different viewpoints on the social relationships during the time period.
					In his essay "Wealth", Carnegie argues that his wealth is spread to the people of the community and it is the duty of the
					wealthy to support the poor. However Jennings Bryan argues that this has not happened and that the nation has a serious problem
					of wealth inequality and the abuse of worker's rights. Although Carnegie attempted to defend himself by stating that he had
					given significant wealth back to the community, it became apparent that the worker's were still mistreated and that he would
					not ammend his practices. This is one of the main reasons that William Jennings Bryan was as successful as he was in running
					his Populist Party campaign. Although he lost, he managed to pull almost 10% of the votes, a number unheard of in the time for
					a third party. The progressives carried on his work into the 20th century and helped to counter the capitalists (such as Andrew
					Carnegie) actions and unfair labor practices. Some people still see Andrew Carnegie as a philathropist who only meant to share
					his wealth, whereas others see him as a tyrannic capitalist who wanted to cut expenses and make significant profits to accumulate
					maximum wealth.

					<blockquote>
					The problem of our age is the proper administration of wealth, so that the ties of brotherhood may still bind together the rich and poor in harmonious relationship. … This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of Wealth: First, to set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning display or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community—the man of wealth thus becoming the mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to administer, doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves. …

[The] best means of benefiting the community is to place within its reach the ladders upon which the aspiring can rise—parks, and means of recreation, by which men are helped in body and minds; works of art, certain to give pleasure and improve the public taste; and public institutions of various kinds, which will improve the general condition of the people—in this manner returning their surplus wealth to the mass of their fellows in the forms best calculated to do them lasting good. …

The laws of accumulation will be left free; the laws of distribution free. Individualism will continue, but the millionaire will be but a trustee for the poor; intrusted for a season with a great part of the increased wealth of the community, but administering it for the community far better than it could or would have done for itself. … Such, in my opinion, is the true Gospel concerning Wealth, obedience to which is destined some day to solve the problem of the Rich and the Poor, and to bring "Peace on earth, among men Good-Will."

					<blockquote>
					Of the self-evident truths set forth in that immortal document the declaration that “All men are created equal” is the most important because it is the most fundamental and comprehends all the others. Its application now would solve aright the questions which vex the civilized world, and would both remove the abuses of legislative power encouraged by our own government and add to the laws we now have such additional statues as are necessary to protect each citizen in the enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

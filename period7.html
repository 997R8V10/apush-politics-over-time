					<p>In the lead-up to World War 2, many European leaders found it more beneficial to simply
					appease the growing power of Hitler. They continually ceded land to Hitler to prevent a war
					in Western Europe. This was partly because of the devestation caused by World War I and 
					a desire to avoid a similar conflict. However, this policy of appeasement allowed Hitler
					and Nazi Germany to continue taking lands in Eastern Europe and continue it's plans for 
					mass genocide. Many people in the United States were unsatisfied with this response and
					demanded action. Dr. Seuss, a popular children's writer, was one of such people, and created
					a series of cartoons and books in order to change public opinion.</p>

					</div>
					
					<p>In the cartoon by Dr. Seuss, an appeaser is shown giving lollipops to several sea serpents
					representing Nazi Germany. The caption is shown reading "One more lollypop, and then you all
					go home!" However, since there are an infinite amount of heads, this cycle will be never ending.
					This is the point that Dr. Seuss is attempting to convey to the people. He believed that it was
					impossible to appease Hitler forever. Eventually, and evidently, there would be a conflict. The
					American public, at the time, supported the European idea of isolationism and appeasement.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>During the Great Depression, there were several debates over whether or not the United States should
					enter World War II. Since 1937, Adolf Hitler had been executing his master plan to take all of the Jewish
					people under his control and place them in various camps. Britain and France also debated if they wanted
					to step in, or continue the policy of appeasement. When Hitler invaded Poland with the USSR, Britain and
					France both declared war on Germany. This was followed by Germany quickly invading France. Within 1 year,
					Britain was the last democracy left standing in Europe. Although President Roosevelt was inclined to enter
					the war in support of Britain, the American Public was still undecided. This situation of intervention vs
					isolationism has been the story throughout the 20th century. President Bush had to make a choice to enter
					Iraq. Many Americans were divided over the issue. Even with Syria, some people felt that it was the United
					States' responsibility to save their people from the dictator who was poisoning his people. Eventually, the
					US entered Syria, but unintentionally strengthened an enemy terrorist organization. With World War II, the
					US decided to send lots of supplies to Britain to help with the war effort. But it was finally Japan's
					bombing of Pearl Harbor that pushed the US into the war. The main debate has been between the identify of
					the United States. Should it be a protector of democracy or be more concerned with it's own interests? This
					debate has existed for over a century and still affects policy today. President Donald Trump's campain was
					based around the policy of America First.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Continuity Over Time</h2>
					<p>During the guilded age to World War II, the United States underwent a variety of changes. The US government
					began recognizing the rights of unions and laborers in the 1930s during the Great Depression. The US had now
					become a fully industrialized society which was able to manufacture weapons during World War I and II. Prior to 1890,
					the US adopted a full laizze-faire system, which gave a lot of power to capitalists. Furthermore, the power of government
					was severely reduced. Government was not supposed to interfere with business. However, in the 1930s, FDR began to change this.
					He increased the power of the federal government and increased several welfare programs. Social Security and minimum wage were
					implemented to provide Americans with monetary support during times of need. Woodrow Wilson also re-established the 
					Federal Banking System abolished by Andrew Jackson in the 19th century. Many of these changes came as a direct result of the
					market failure in 1929. The previous system caused a decline in prices for farmers, and allowed all the banks in the country
					to fail simulatneously, leading to a worldwide economic collapse. In the 1930s and 40s, political parties began realigning.
					Republicans, previously associated with the abolition of slavery, now became more conservative and bound to the laizze-faire
					system. However, President Harry Truman changed the democratic platform to include Civil Rights, allowing him to gain a
					new base of support from African Americans. Truman realized the need for Civil Rights after World War II, since the US
					had just defeated a power of rascism and persecution in Germany. In the 19th century, the Democratic party was focused
					on segregation and Jim Crow laws, but had now transformed into the modern version of the party. Furthermore, with President
					FDR, American foreign policy changed from one of isolationism to one of interventionism. Americans now believed they were
					obligated to be the world protectors of democracy. Much of this was due to the failings of WWI to resolve conflicts,
					leading to WWII. The US and Britain helped to establish the United Nations, a international organization dedicated
					to prevent conflicts such as WWII from happening, while protecting human rights. Some things stayed the same, however.
					Jim Crow laws were still in effect in the South, and would be until the 60s. Nativism still existed and led to Japanese
					internment during World War II as a result. However, many signs, such as Truman desegregating the military, showed promising
					signs of change.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conflicting Sources</h2>
					<p>During 1941, there was a massive debate between interventionism and isolationism. Britain was running out
					of money, and asked the US for help. Roosevelt initially responded stating that public opinion was not in
					favor of intervention. However, Roosevelt eventually changed his mind, and pressured Congress to create the Lend-Lease
					act, which would provide Britain with "Any weapon, munition. aircraft, vessel, or boat". However, many people opposed
					Lend-Lease, namely Burton Wheeler. He stated that "Never before have the American people been asked or compelled to
					give so bounteously and so completely of their tax dollars to any foreign nation." This severe difference in opinion
					existed primarily because of the carnage left after WWI. Americans were very disinterested in war after the devastating
					losses from the Great War, and felt that the Lend-Lease act was a step towards WWII. During this time period, much of
					the United States still felt isolationist as a result of WWI and the Great Depression. The main reason the American 
					People accepted WWII was because of the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor later in 1941. Roosevelt's speech also helped
					sway public opinion into accepting the war. By the time Pearl Harbor occured, almost 80% of Americans were in support.

					A BILL
Further to promote the defense of the United States, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate add House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be cited as "An Act to Promote the Defense of the United States".

SEC. 2. As used in this Act -

(a) The term "defense article" means -

(1) Any weapon, munition. aircraft, vessel, or boat;

(2) Any machinery, facility, tool, material, or supply necessary for the manufacture, production, processing, repair, servicing, or operation of any article described in this subsection;

(3) Any component material or part of or equipment for any article described in this subsection;

					<blockquote>
					Never before have the American people been asked or compelled to give so bounteously and so completely of their tax dollars to any foreign nation. Never before has the Congress of the United States been asked by any President to violate international law. Never before has this nation resorted to duplicity in the conduct of its foreign affairs. Never before has the United States given to one man the power to strip this nation of its defenses. Never before has a Congress coldly and flatly been asked to abdicate. If the American people want a dictatorship - if they want a totalitarian form of government and if they want war - this bill should be steam-rollered through Congress, as is the wont of President Roosevelt. Approval of this legislation means war, open and complete warfare. I, therefore, ask the American people before they supinely accept it: Was the last World War worthwhile?

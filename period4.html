					<p>This period of history was marked with examples of reform movements. One of these was temperance: an attempt to stop
					the American habit of drinking. This is very important because it meant that Americans were willing to change and progress
					socially. It was also the first time that women started getting involved in the public "sphere".</p>

					<p>They were concerned for their safety as men who drank often mistreated their wives and sometimes left them as widows.
					This was known as the Temperance movement and led to the temporary ban on alcohol. Although this was eventually repealed,
					it did at least show that the US was ready for dramatic change, and set the stage for the war against slavery. People's
					lifestyles, habits, and ways of life changed dramatically during this era.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>Many radical new reforms took place in the early 1800s, as Americans moved away from the social norms as the Industrial
					Revolution caused an economic change. The election of 1828 led to Andrew Jackson becoming a revolution. Andrew Jackson was
					considered the first truly democratic president. Most of the previous presidents had been rich aristocrats. He was expected
					to be a true leader of the people. However during his presidency, he actually ended up strengthening the central government's
					power, as opposed to providing more power to states. Many presidents since have had the same problem. In 2009, when Obama was
					inagurated, the country thought of him as a huge revolution, an escape from the previous presidency of George Bush. However,
					although he accomplished some of what he set out to do, it was not as revolutionary as the populus had hoped. In the case
					of Andrew Jackson, many contraversial decisions were made, causing public unrest. However, the majority of the population
					supported him. This is relateable to the recent election of Donald Trump. Trump's campaining actions were very contraversial,
					and towards the end of the race, chances of victory for him looked very slim. However, when election day came, he was more
					popular ane ended up winning. Although his reasons for winning involved his radical strategy, he has reduced this aspect
					since the win. Many of his policies were rejected or made more normal after the election. This can be compared to Jackson's
					election where he won for promising to provide more control to state governments. Although he did achieve some of this,
					he generally strengthened and asserted the central government's power over state governments.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Continuity Over Time</h2>
					<p>Ideology in the 4th period changed significantly from previous ones. Although the idea of separate spheres for men and women
					still existed, women began to take an active role in abolitionist and temperance movements. This was mainly because people felt
					it was ok for women to take a role in temperance movements since it still concerned them. However, people felt that they took
					it too far by leading abolitionist movements. Since the pressing issue at the time was slavery, this wasn't as enforced. Another
					major change was the change from the Federalist idea of government to the Republican and then Democratic view. Before 1800, the
					Federalists wanted a strong central government. After 1800, and a series of mistakes by John Adams, Jefferson was the first
					Republican president. The second party system then resulted in a shift from the "agrarian farmer" to the "urban worker". This was
					primarily a result of the industrial revolution which led to big cities and large factories. Industrial manufacturing can be cited
					as a driving force for many of these movements. Women could get jobs at textile factories, and therefore had more say in movements.
					Communication and transportation was improved since period 3 as a result of the telegraph and railroad. The industrial revolution
					also increased the standard of living which allowed for a more educated public which resulted in the voting shift in the second
					party system.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conflicting Sources</h2>
					<p>One of the most contraversial actions taken by Andrew Jackson was forcing the Cherokee Tribe to relocate to the dry arid and
					foreign climate of Oklahoma. Most of the other tribes were forced to relocate from Southwestern states to make way for American
					Expansion. Although compensation was paid, it was often not adequate, and not just either. John Ross, a "civilized" Cherokee
					argued that "[The Cherokee] are stripped of every atribute of freedom and eligibility for legal self-defence. Our property may
					be pludered before our eyes... We are sickened... by the audacious practices of unprincipled men." Ross argues that by forcing
					them to leave, they are being denied the unalienable rights and rejecting the US's principles. However, Andrew Jackson stated
					that "The waves of population and civilization are rolling to the westward, and we now propose to acquire the countries occupied
					by the red men of the South and West by a fair exchange, and, at the expense of the United States, to send them to land where
					their existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual." Jackson believed that as the Cherokee were already declining, he
					would help them by preventing conflicts between the Americans and the natives. His other argument is that they are "rude" and
					"savage" and weren't beneficial to the US. He also stated that they are inhibiting "more than 12,000,000 happy people, and
					filled with all the blessings of liberty, civilization and religion". The reason most of these prejudices existed was due to
					earlier conflicts and the need for more land. Jackson had encountered many fights with the Native Americans, and felt that
					he should represent the general Americans grievances by moving these "savages" to another location where they wouldn't cause
					problems. However, this caused contravercies since it was against what the US government stood for. This was mostly because
					of geographical differences. Most of the Native Americans in the northeast had already been dealt with in the past, however
					in the South, many tribes still remained and continually caused problems. The North didn't recognize the problem the way the
					South did and focused on the morals of removal. In this time period, many geographical issues such as the Indian-Removal crisis,
					and blatant disregard for the values of the Constitution demonstrated the growing tensions between North and South. Slavery
					was also related to this as the North (rightfully so) considered this an immoral institution. However the South, dependent on
					slave labor didn't.</p>

					Letter from Chief John Ross, "To the Senate and House of Representatives"<br />
					[Red Clay Council Ground, Cherokee Nation, September 28, 1836]<br />
					It is well known that for a number of years past we have been harassed by a series of vexations, which it is deemed unnecessary
					to recite in detail, but the evidence of which our delegation will be prepared to furnish. With a view to bringing our troubles
					to a close, a delegation was appointed on the 23rd of October, 1835, by the General Council of the nation, clothed with full powers
					to enter into arrangements with the Government of the United States, for the final adjustment of all our existing difficulties.
					The delegation failing to effect an arrangement with the United States commissioner, then in the nation, proceeded, agreeably to
					their instructions in that case, to Washington City, for the purpose of negotiating a treaty with the authorities of the United States.
					After the departure of the Delegation, a contract was made by the Rev. John F. Schermerhorn, and certain individual Cherokees,
					purporting to be a "treaty, concluded at New Echota, in the State of Georgia, on the 29th day of December, 1835, by General
					William Carroll and John F. Schermerhorn, commissioners on the part of the United States, and the chiefs, headmen, and people of
					the Cherokee tribes of Indians." A spurious Delegation, in violation of a special injunction of the general council of the nation,
					proceeded to Washington City with this pretended treaty, and by false and fraudulent representations supplanted in the favor of
					the Government the legal and accredited Delegation of the Cherokee people, and obtained for this instrument, after making important
					alterations in its provisions, the recognition of the United States Government. And now it is presented to us as a treaty, ratified
					by the Senate, and approved by the President [Andrew Jackson], and our acquiescence in its requirements demanded, under the sanction
					of the displeasure of the United States, and the threat of summary compulsion, in case of refusal. It comes to us, not through our
					legitimate authorities, the known and usual medium of communication between the Government of the United States and our nation, but 
					through the agency of a complication of powers, civil and military. By the stipulations of this instrument, we are despoiled of our
					private possessions, the indefeasible property of individuals. We are stripped of every attribute of freedom and eligibility for
					legal self-defence. Our property may be plundered before our eyes; violence may be committed on our persons; even our lives may be
					taken away, and there is none to regard our complaints. We are denationalized; we are disfranchised. We are deprived of membership
					in the human family! We have neither land nor home, nor resting place that can be called our own. And this is effected by the
					provisions of a compact which assumes the venerated, the sacred appellation of treaty. We are overwhelmed! Our hearts are sickened,
					our utterance is paralized, when we reflect on the condition in which we are placed, by the audacious practices of unprincipled men,
					who have managed their stratagems with so much dexterity as to impose on the Government of the United States, in the face of our
					earnest, solemn, and reiterated protestations. The instrument in question is not the act of our Nation; we are not parties to its
					covenants; it has not received the sanction of our people. The makers of it sustain no office nor appointment in our Nation, under
					the designation of Chiefs, Head men, or any other title, by which they hold, or could acquire, authority to assume the reins of
					Government, and to make bargain and sale of our rights, our possessions, and our common country. And we are constrained solemnly
					to declare, that we cannot but contemplate the enforcement of the stipulations of this instrument on us, against our consent, as an
					ct of injustice and oppression, which, we are well persuaded, can never knowingly be countenanced by the Government and people of
					he United States; nor can we believe it to be the design of these honorable and highminded individuals, who stand at the head of the
					Govt., to bind a whole Nation, by the acts of a few unauthorized individuals. And, therefore, we, the parties to be affected by the
					result, appeal with confidence to the justice, the magnanimity, the compassion, of your honorable bodies, against the enforcement,
					n us, of the provisions of a compact, in the formation of which we have had no agency.

					<blockquote>
					It gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy of the Government, steadily pursued for nearly thirty years,
					in relation to the removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is approaching to a happy consummation. Two important tribes
					have accepted the provision made for their removal at the last session of Congress, and it is believed that their example will induce
					the remaining tribes also to seek the same obvious advantages. The consequences of a speedy removal will be important to the United
					States, to individual States, and to the Indians themselves. The pecuniary advantages which it promises to the Government are the
					least of its recommendations. It puts an end to all possible danger of collision between the authorities of the General and State
					Governments on account of the Indians. It will place a dense and civilized population in large tracts of country now occupied by
					a few savage hunters. By opening the whole territory between Tennessee on the north and Louisiana on the south to the settlement
					of the whites it will incalculably strengthen the southwestern frontier and render the adjacent States strong enough to repel
					future invasions without remote aid. It will relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of Alabama of Indian
					occupancy, and enable those States to advance rapidly in population, wealth, and power. It will separate the Indians from immediate
					contact with settlements of whites; free them from the power of the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and
					under their own rude institutions; will retard the progress of decay, which is lessening their numbers, and perhaps cause them
					gradually, under the protection of the Government and through the influence of good counsels, to cast off their savage habits
					and become an interesting, civilized, and Christian community. What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and
					ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms embellished with
					all the improvements which art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than 12,000,000 happy people, and filled with
					all the blessings of liberty, civilization and religion? The present policy of the Government is but a continuation of the same
					progressive change by a milder process. The tribes which occupied the countries now constituting the Eastern States were annihilated
					or have melted away to make room for the whites. The waves of population and civilization are rolling to the westward, and we now
					propose to acquire the countries occupied by the red men of the South and West by a fair exchange, and, at the expense of the United
					States, to send them to land where their existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual. Doubtless it will be painful to leave
					the graves of their fathers; but what do they more than our ancestors did or than our children are now doing? To better their condition
					in an unknown land our forefathers left all that was dear in earthly objects. Our children by thousands yearly leave the land of their
					birth to seek new homes in distant regions. Does Humanity weep at these painful separations from everything, animate and inanimate,
					with which the young heart has become entwined? Far from it. It is rather a source of joy that our country affords scope where our young
					population may range unconstrained in body or in mind, developing the power and facilities of man in their highest perfection. These
					remove hundreds and almost thousands of miles at their own expense, purchase the lands they occupy, and support themselves at their
					new homes from the moment of their arrival. Can it be cruel in this Government when, by events which it can not control, the Indian
					is made discontented in his ancient home to purchase his lands, to give him a new and extensive territory, to pay the expense of his
					removal, and support him a year in his new abode? How many thousands of our own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of removing
					to the West on such conditions! If the offers made to the Indians were extended to them, they would be hailed with gratitude and joy. And
					is it supposed that the wandering savage has a stronger attachment to his home than the settled, civilized Christian? Is it more afflicting
					to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and children? Rightly considered, the policy of the General
					Government toward the red man is not only liberal, but generous. He is unwilling to submit to the laws of the States and mingle
					with their population. To save him from this alternative, or perhaps utter annihilation, the General Government kindly offers him
					new home, and proposes to pay the whole expense of his removal and settlement.

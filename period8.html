					<p>During the Cold War, there were several debates over Communism (The System that the USSR ran on), and Capitalism (The
					System that the US promoted). Although Capitalism survived in the long run, at the time, the outcome was unclear. Both
					superpowers believed wholeheartedly in their systems, and neither would back down. Both hosted fairs in order to display
					products made by each respective system, the newest in technology. Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev had a friendly
					debate in front of a model of an American kitchen, about the progress of Communism vs. Capitalism.</p>

						</a>
						<span class="caption text-muted">Soviet Premier Khrushchev and President Nixon debating.</span>
					</div>
					
					<p>These "Kitchen Debates" formed the basis for much of the conflicts and proxy conflicts as many were formed in order
					to defend ideals. Many new countries had to make the choice as well, with both superpowers interested in spreading
					their respective models. During this time period, politics was completely consumed by the cold war. Political debates,
					and political discussions all centered around the Cold War. Most of these wars, political decisions, and diplomatic
					solutions, were based on the clash of values such as those shown in the Kitchen Debate.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Synthesis Article</h2>
					<p>In many ways, the cold war has continued to shape political decisions even today. During the Cold War, the United States
					adopted a policy of containment in order to halt the spread of Communism. As a result, the US became involved in several
					revolutions and proxy conflicts in order to promote Capitalism over Communism. Even today, the US continues to get involved
					in conflicts involving Russia. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and after Boris Yeltsin tranferred power to
					Vladamir Putin, Russia has continued to become involved in proxy conflicts as well. Syria is a perfect example of this. 
					While the United States attempted to support the rebellion against Assad (The Dictator of Syria), Russia backed him, since
					he was a friend to Russia. This can be seen in several proxy conflicts such as Iraq, Vietnam, Korea, etc. Several of these
					proxy conflicts, continue to cause diplomatic and political tension today. North Korea continues to remain in the forfront
					of politics today, China and Vietnam still remain communist states, and Russia still maintains it's intent to be a world
					superpower. Russia and the United States continue to oppose each other even after the end of the Soviet Union in the 90s.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Continuity Over Time</h2>
					<p>The United States' foreign policy changed significantly from Period 7 to Period 8. Most of the earliest 20th century
					consisted of the US adopting a policy of isolationism. Congress reluctantly entered World War 1 only after it seemed like
					Germany was intent on attacking the US. Even during WWII, the US only entered the war after Pearl Harbor, when European
					countries had already been fighting for several years. Despite this, the US stayed away from external conflicts, and
					focussed on internal affairs. After World War 2, though, the US came out as one of the world's leading superpowers, and
					adopted a new foreign policy of intervention. The US was now intent on preventing the spread of Communism, and entered
					any conflict where this was likely. This was a major change from the past, when the US only entered conficts when
					provoked. This also led to a military buildup that had not been seen before the Cold War. And this was during a time
					when the US wasn't particularly in a conflict. This marked a major change from isolationism, which characterized the
					early 20th century, to intervention, which the US adopted into the 21st century. This change was mostly a result of
					the Soviet Union also being a world superpower and promoting Communism, to which the US was strongly opposed. Americans
					saw Communism as a direct threat to democracy and capitalism, which the US had thrived on since the beginning of it's
					existance. As a result, the US changed it's foreign policy to protect democracy and capitalism.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conflicting Sources</h2>
					<p>After 1945, there were many who opposed and who supported the US's new policy of containment for Communism. Some
					saw the arms buildup as unnecessary and even possibly catastrophic. Other saw it as beneficial and required in order
					to protect the United States from an attack by the Soviet Union. As John F. Kennedy stated in his address to Congress,
					"Certainly we must stand devote all our available energies to the task of rebuilding our military strength and we use
					every means at our disposal to pursuade our friends in the West to do likewise." However, the opposition stated that
					this would divide the world "permantently into two armed camps," and also result in the world being under constant
					threat of nuclear war. The main reason for these differences in opinion, was the change in foreign policy from Period 7
					to Period 8. Some people still believed in the foreign policy from Period 7, as it meant the US should only focus on it's
					interests. However, interventionalists argued that the spread of Communism was the in the US' interests, as it could
					potentially endanger the US.

					<blockquote>
					But In our efforts to contain the tide of Communist expansion, it would be a mistake to judge the Communist threat as primarily military, although it is Russian military prestige that has force & gives persua persuasion to her [illegible] to the beliefs of its political & economic doctrines.

[illegible]

Certainly we must stand devote all our available energies to the task of rebuilding our military strength and we should use every means at our disposal to persuade our friends in the West to do likewise.

					<blockquote>
					The pact destroys the chances of European recovery. A permanently militarized Europe is doomed to living on an American dole. The pact is not an instrument of defense but a military alliance designed for aggression. It bypasses the United Nations and violates its Charter in a most flagrant manner. It divides the world permanently into two armed camps. And it provocatively establishes military bases on the borders of the Soviet Union.
